This repository is a reference implementation and start state for a modern decoupled WordPress workflow utilizing [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), Continuous Integration (CI), Automated Testing, and Pantheon. It uses CircleCI for continuous integration and includes sane defaults for an enterprise Wordpress site. This includes default settings, utility plugins with default configuration, environment-specific configuration via Roots Config, Quicksilver automation scripts, local development tooling, and basic tests.

## Quickstart
1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:%GH_ORG%/db-2865-2.git
```
2. Install composer dependencies:
```
cd <your repo> && composer install
```
3. Start local development environment:
```
lando start
```

## Local Development
This repo includes a .lando.yml file which is pre-configured. You simply just need to run `lando start` in the directory where the .lando.yml file resides and this will spin up a local Pantheon environment which closely mirrors the architecture of Pantheon hosting. The first time you run `lando start` you will be prompted to enter a Pantheon token if you don't have one set up already on your machine. Once lando successfully starts your project, you should see output in your terminal similar to the below:

```
 NAME                  db-2865-2
 LOCATION              /Users/myuser/sites/db-2865-2
 SERVICES              appserver_nginx, appserver, database, cache, edge_ssl, edge, index
 APPSERVER_NGINX URLS  https://localhost:51725
                       http://localhost:51726
 EDGE_SSL URLS         https://localhost:51730
 EDGE URLS             http://localhost:51729
                       http://db-2865-2.lndo.site/
                       https://db-2865-2.lndo.site/
```


## Helpful Local Development commands
Sync dev environment database to local environment:
```
lando pull --database=dev --files=none --code=none
```


Sync dev environment database and files to local environment:
```
lando pull --database=dev --files=dev --code=none
```

You should now be able to edit your site locally. The steps above do not need to be completed on subsequent starts. You can stop Lando with `lando stop` and start it again with `lando start`.

**Warning:** do NOT push/pull code between Lando and Pantheon directly. All code should be pushed to GitHub and deployed to Pantheon through a continuous integration service, such as CircleCI.

Composer, Terminus and wp-cli commands should be run in Lando rather than on the host machine. This is done by prefixing the desired command with `lando`. For example, after a change to `composer.json` run `lando composer update` rather than `composer update`.

## Important files and directories

### `/web`

Pantheon will serve the site from the `/web` subdirectory due to the configuration in `pantheon.yml`. This is necessary for a Composer based workflow. Having your website in this subdirectory also allows for tests, scripts, and other files related to your project to be stored in your repo without polluting your web document root or being web accessible from Pantheon. They may still be accessible from your version control project if it is public. See [the `pantheon.yml`](https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml/#nested-docroot) documentation for details.

### `/web/wp`

Even within the `/web` directory you may notice that other directories and files are in different places compared to a default WordPress installation. [WordPress allows installing WordPress core in its own directory](https://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory), which is necessary when installing WordPress with Composer.

See `/web/wp-config.php` for key settings, such as `WP_SITEURL`, which must be updated so that WordPress core functions properly in the relocated `/web/wp` directory. The overall layout of directories in the repo is inspired by, but doesn't exactly mirror, [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock).

### `composer.json`
This project uses Composer to manage third-party PHP dependencies.

The `require` section of `composer.json` should be used for any dependencies your web project needs, even those that might only be used on non-Live environments. All dependencies in `require` will be pushed to Pantheon.

The `require-dev` section should be used for dependencies that are not a part of the web application but are necesarry to build or test the project. Some example are `php_codesniffer` and `phpunit`. Dev dependencies will not be deployed to Pantheon.

If you are just browsing this repository on GitHub, you may not see some of the directories mentioned above, such as `web/wp`. That is because WordPress core and its plugins are installed via Composer and ignored in the `.gitignore` file.

Third party WordPress dependencies, such as plugins and themes, are added to the project via `composer.json`. The `composer.lock` file keeps track of the exact version of dependency. [Composer `installer-paths`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-do-i-install-a-package-to-a-custom-path-for-my-framework.md#how-do-i-install-a-package-to-a-custom-path-for-my-framework-) are used to ensure the WordPress dependencies are downloaded into the appropriate directory.

Non-WordPress dependencies are downloaded to the `/vendor` directory.

### `.ci`
This `.ci` directory is where all of the scripts that run on Continuous Integration are stored. Provider specific configuration files, such as `.circle/config.yml` and `.gitlab-ci.yml`, make use of these scripts.

The scripts are organized into subdirectories of `.ci` according to their function: `build`, `deploy`, or `test`.

#### Build Scripts `.ci/build`
Steps for building an artifact suitable for deployment. Feel free to add other build scripts here, such as installing Node dependencies, depending on your needs.

- `.ci/build/php` installs PHP dependencies with Composer

#### Build Scripts `.ci/deploy`
Scripts for facilitating code deployment to Pantheon.

- `.ci/deploy/pantheon/create-multidev` creates a new [Pantheon multidev environment](https://pantheon.io/docs/multidev/) for branches other than the default Git branch
  - Note that not all users have multidev access. Please consult [the multidev FAQ doc](https://pantheon.io/docs/multidev-faq/) for details.
- `.ci/deploy/pantheon/dev-multidev` deploys the built artifact to either the Pantheon `dev` or a multidev environment, depending on the Git branch

#### Automated Test Scripts `.ci/tests`
Scripts that run automated tests. Feel free to add or remove scripts here depending on your testing needs.

**Static Testing** `.ci/test/static` and `tests/unit`
Static tests analyze code without executing it. It is good at detecting syntax error but not functionality.

- `.ci/test/static/run` Runs [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards), PHP Unit, and [PHP syntax checking](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.php-check-syntax.php).
- `tests/unit/bootstrap.php` Bootstraps the Composer autoloader
- `tests/unit/TestAssert.php` An example Unit test. Project specific test files will need to be created in `tests/unit`.

**Visual Regression Testing** `.ci/test/visual-regression`
Visual regression testing uses a headless browser to take screenshots of web pages and compare them for visual differences.

- `.ci/test/visual-regression/run` Runs [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) visual regression testing.
- `.ci/test/visual-regression/backstopConfig.js` The [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) configuration file. Setting here will need to be updated for your project. For example, the `pathsToTest` variable determines the URLs to test.

**Behat Testing** `.ci/test/behat` and `tests/behat`
[Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/) is an acceptance/end-to-end testing framework written in PHP. It faciliates testing the fully built WordPress site on Pantheon infrastucture. [WordHat](https://wordhat.info/) is used to help with integrating Behat and WordPress.

- `.ci/test/behat/initialize` deletes any existing WordPress user from Behat testing and creates a backup of the environment to be tested
- `.ci/test/behat/run` sets the `BEHAT_PARAMS` environment variable with dynamic information necessary for Behat and configure it to use wp-cli via [Terminus](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/), creates the necessary WordPress user, starts headless Chrome, and runs Behat
- `.ci/test/behat/cleanup` restores the previously made database backup, deletes the WordPress user used for Behat testing, and saves screenshots taken by Behat
- `tests/behat/behat-pantheon.yml` Behat configuration file compatible with running tests against a Pantheon site
- `tests/behat/tests/behat/features` Where Behat test files, with the `.feature` extension, should be stored. The provided example tests will need to be replaced with project specific tests.
  - `tests/behat/tests/behat/features/visit-homepage.feature` A Behat test file which visits the homepage and verifies a `200` response
  - `tests/behat/tests/behat/features/admin-login.feature` A Behat test file which logs into the WordPress dashboard as an administrator and verifies acess to new user creation
  - `tests/behat/tests/behat/features/admin-login.feature` A Behat test file which logs into the WordPress dashboard as an administrator, updates the `blogname` and `blogdescription` settings, clears the Pantheon cache, visits the home page, and verifies the update blog name and description appear.
